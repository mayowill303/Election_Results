# Election_Results

I assisted the board of elections with an audit of the election results for U.S. Congressional precinct in Colorado. I created reports on the election results as follows:

1. Total Votes
2. Total Votes per each candidate
3. The percentage of votes per each candidate
4. Winner of the election based on the popular vote

Rather than using Excel, the board of elections wants to know if there is a way to automate this process. Python was the perfect solution for this.  I performed the analysis using Python 3.9.7 via VS Code  with Git Bash to push to GitHub.
